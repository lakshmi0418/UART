1. What is UART?

UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter.

It is a serial communication protocol used to transmit and receive data between two devices.

ðŸ”¹ 2. How Does UART Work?

It sends data bit by bit (serially) over a single wire.

It uses two lines:

TX (Transmit)

RX (Receive)

Data is framed with:

Start bit

Data bits (usually 8)

Optional parity bit

Stop bit(s)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Key Parameters to Configure UART:

Baud rate (speed, e.g., 9600 bps, 115200 bps)

Number of data bits (usually 8)

Stop bits (1 or 2)

Parity (None, Even, Odd)

Flow control (optional â€“ hardware/software)

ðŸ”¹ 4. Modes of Operation:

Polling (CPU checks regularly)

Interrupt-based (efficient, non-blocking)

DMA (Direct Memory Access) (for high-speed transfers)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Real-Time Usage Examples:

Communicating with:

GSM/LTE Modules (like Cavli, SIM800, Quectel)

GPS modules

Bluetooth modules (like HC-05)

Debugging with USB-to-Serial tools

Sending AT commands and receiving responses

ðŸ”¹ 6. Debugging UART:

Use serial terminal tools: RealTerm, PuTTY, Tera Term

USB-to-UART converters (FTDI, CP2102)

Use logic analyzers to check signal timing
What is Baud Rate in UART?
ðŸ”¹ Definition:What is the baud rate and how do you decide it in a smart meter project

The baud rate in UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) defines the speed of data transmission, i.e., how many bits are transmitted per second.

Baud Rate = Bits Per Second (bps)

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
What is the baud rate and how do you decide it in a smart meter project?

Baud rate is the speed of UART communication, measured in bits per second.
In our smart meter project, we used 115200 baud for fast and reliable data exchange with the Cavli module.
The rate was chosen based on module support, MCU capability, and real-time performance needs.
It ensured quick AT command handling without blocking the main application.

What is the difference between UART and USART?

USART in synchronous mode can be faster and more accurate over longer distances compared to UART
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) supports only asynchronous serial communication.
USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes.
In asynchronous mode, data is sent without a clock (like UART).
In synchronous mode, a clock signal is used for faster, coordinated communication.

. How did the smart meter communicate with the Cavli module via UART?

The smart meter's microcontroller connected to the Cavli module via a UART interface (TX/RX).

UART was configured at 115200 baud, using interrupts to handle real-time communication.

Communication was based on sending and receiving AT commands to control the module.

âœ… 2. What kind of data was exchanged between the meter and the Cavli module?

The meter sent sensor readings like voltage, current, and energy values to the Cavli module.

The module used this data to send it over LTE-M/NB-IoT to a remote cloud server.

We also exchanged status updates, connection info, and received network response messages.

âœ… 3. Did you use AT commands to control the Cavli module? Give examples.

Yes, we used AT commands over UART to configure and control the Cavli module.

Example: AT+CGATT=1 to attach to the network, AT+MQTTPUB to publish data to MQTT.

Commands were sent from the MCU, and we waited for "OK" or error responses.

âœ… 4. How did you parse multi-line responses from the Cavli module over UART?

We implemented a ring buffer to collect incoming data line by line.

Parsed responses by checking for line endings like \r\n and detecting "OK" or "+RESP:" prefixes.

For complex replies, we used a state machine to track the command-response lifecycle.

âœ… 5. Did you implement any acknowledgment or retry mechanism if a UART command failed?

Yes, we waited for expected responses within a timeout window after sending each command.

If no response or an error was received, the command was re-sent up to 3 times.

This improved reliability in poor network or noisy communication conditions.

How did you handle UART in real-time? Polling, interrupts, or DMA?

We used interrupt-driven UART to handle data efficiently without blocking the CPU.

This allowed the microcontroller to perform other tasks while receiving data asynchronously.

DMA was considered for higher throughput but interrupts met our project requirements.

2. How did you avoid blocking the main application while waiting for UART data?

By using interrupts, UART reception ran in the background, triggering only when data arrived.

Data was stored in a ring buffer, allowing the main application to process it asynchronously.

This design kept the main loop free and responsive to other real-time tasks.

3. What happens if the Cavli module sends data faster than the microcontroller can read?

Incoming data is buffered in a ring buffer to prevent immediate data loss.

If the buffer overflows, older data might be overwritten or lost, so buffer size and processing speed are critical.

We optimized ISR and processing to minimize such overflow scenarios.

4. Did you use a ring buffer or queue for UART receive? How did it help?

Yes, we implemented a ring buffer to store incoming UART bytes efficiently.

It allowed continuous data reception without blocking, handling bursts of data smoothly.

This prevented data loss and simplified parsing multi-line responses.

5. How did you debug UART communication between the smart meter and Cavli?

We used serial terminal tools like PuTTY and RealTerm to monitor UART traffic in real time.

Logic analyzers (e.g., Saleae) helped capture signal timing and detect errors.

Logging UART data helped identify command-response mismatches and communication issues.

6. Which tools did you use to monitor or sniff UART data?

Primary tools were USB-to-UART converters connected to a PC for serial terminal monitoring.

We also used logic analyzers for low-level signal inspection.

Occasionally, oscilloscope checks were done for physical line integrity.

7. Did you face any framing or parity errors during communication?

Occasionally, framing errors occurred due to baud rate mismatches or noise.

We minimized these by confirming matched baud rates and proper cable shielding.

Parity was typically disabled to simplify communication and reduce overhead.

8. How did you troubleshoot baud rate mismatches or corrupt data?

We verified baud rates on both MCU and Cavli module to ensure they matched exactly.

Used logic analyzers to observe data waveform timing and correct any discrepancies.

Adjusted UART settings and retested until data was stable and error-free.

9. What are some UART errors youâ€™ve encountered and how did you fix them?

Encountered framing errors, data overruns, and occasional buffer overflows.

Fixed by improving ISR efficiency, increasing buffer size, and validating UART config.

Also improved hardware wiring and signal integrity to reduce noise-induced errors.

10. Can you explain the AT command flow for sending data to the cloud using the Cavli module?

We sent AT commands like AT+CGATT=1 to attach network and AT+MQTTPUB to publish data.

Each command was followed by waiting for an "OK" or "ERROR" response before proceeding.

Data from the smart meter was formatted and sent in payloads via these commands.

11. How did you ensure proper response handling (OK/ERROR) in UART from Cavli?

We implemented a state machine to track commands and expected responses.

Timeouts were used to detect missing or delayed replies, triggering retries.

Responses were parsed line-by-line from the UART buffer to confirm success or error.

12. How did you handle unsolicited messages (like incoming data or status updates) from Cavli?

We monitored UART continuously and identified unsolicited messages by specific prefixes (e.g., +CMTI:).

These messages were handled asynchronously without disrupting ongoing command sequences.

Handlers updated internal state or triggered relevant actions based on message type.

13. Did you integrate MQTT or TCP/IP stack using AT commands via UART?

Yes, we controlled the Cavli moduleâ€™s MQTT client via AT commands to publish meter data.

Commands established TCP/IP connections, subscribed/published topics, and handled acknowledgments.

This offloaded network protocol complexity from the MCU, simplifying firmware design.
